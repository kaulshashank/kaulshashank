### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shashank and I'm obsessed with building tools and products that make our jobs easier. 

I love collaborating with people and I'm really easy to approach. I also love reading research on cyber security and hope that I will one day be able to make an impact in the security community.

Almost forgot, I love playing :video_game:. MMO's with amazing lore are my ultimate weakness. :grimacing:

Currently learning:
1. Rust
2. How to win the never ending battle of seeing projects through to the end.
